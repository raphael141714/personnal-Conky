# personnal-Conky
Personnal conky config, inspired by the Numix theme.
Sorry, I'm french, therefore my conky is in french :)

## Installing it

You will need theses fonts :   
Content : [Standard Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)   
Titles : [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab)   
Monospace font : [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)   

Then install conky, obviously.
If you download this as an archive, simply unpack it in `~/`
You should then have a `~/conky/` folder, and more importantly a `~/conky/graphs.lua` file.
Once all that is done, rename `conkyrc`, `conkyrc_wlan0`, `conkyrc_headless` or `conkyrc_headless_wlan0` to `.conkyrc`.
It depends on what you want :
* conkyrc :

* conkyrc_wlan0 :

* conkyrc_headless :

* conkyrc_headless_wlan0 :

Then, just launch `conky` and voil√†, it works.
